For context, common HTTP servers include:
Windows options, such as Internet Information Services (IIS).
Linux options, such as Apache HTTP Web Server, Nginx, and Apache Tomcat.

At a fundamental level, there are three types of compute options: virtual machines, container services, and serverless. If youâ€™re coming to AWS with prior infrastructure knowledge, a virtual machine can often be the easiest compute option in AWS to understand. This is because a virtual machine emulates a physical server and allows you to install an HTTP server to run your applications. To run these virtual machines, you install a hypervisor on a host machine. This hypervisor provisions the resources to create and run your virtual machines.In AWS, these virtual machines are called Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud or Amazon EC2. Behind the scenes, AWS operates and manages the host machines and the hypervisor layer. AWS also installs the virtual machine operating system, called the guest operating system.
